### 18S QIIME-Compatible Database:
The 18S QIIME-compatible database is tailored for the analysis of eukaryotic microbial communities using the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene as a molecular marker. The `reads.qza` file encompasses processed 18S rRNA gene sequence reads, the `taxa.qza` file provides taxonomic annotations linked to these reads, and the `classifier.qza` file includes a trained classifier for accurate taxonomic classification.

### 16S QIIME-Compatible Database:
Designed for the exploration of bacterial and archaeal communities, the 16S QIIME-compatible database utilizes the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene as a marker. The `reads.qza` file contains processed sequence reads, the `taxa.qza` file holds taxonomic annotations for the reads, and the `classifier.qza` file comprises a trained classifier for precise taxonomic assignments.

### ITS QIIME-Compatible Database:
Tailored for the analysis of fungal communities, the ITS QIIME-compatible database employs the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region as a gene marker. The `reads.qza` file stores processed ITS sequence reads, the `taxa.qza` file contains taxonomic information associated with the reads, and the `classifier.qza` file houses a trained classifier for accurate taxonomic classification.

### nifH QIIME-Compatible Database:
Focused on nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the nifH QIIME-compatible database utilizes the nitrogenase reductase (nifH) gene as a marker. The `reads.qza` file includes processed nifH gene sequence reads, the `taxa.qza` file provides taxonomic annotations for the reads, and the `classifier.qza` file contains a trained classifier for precise taxonomic assignments.

### acdS QIIME-Compatible Database:
Customized for the study of bacterial communities involved in the biogeochemical cycling of ethylene, the acdS QIIME-compatible database employs the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (acdS) gene as a marker. The `reads.qza` file contains processed acdS gene sequence reads, the `taxa.qza` file provides taxonomic annotations for the reads, and the `classifier.qza` file incorporates a trained classifier for accurate taxonomic classification.
